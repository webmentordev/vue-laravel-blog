# Simple VueJs & Laravel Blog

It is a simple blog build with vuejs (FrontEnd) and Laravel (BackEnd). VueJS is not SEO friendly but you will get an idea How APIs will work.  

## Info
Add Port number at the end of APP_URL. e.g APP_URL=http://localhost:8000  
The blog thumbnails will not work if Laravel Domain and Port is not defined. That's why we setup domain.
